features:
  - |
    A new transpiler pass
    :class:`qiskit_ibm_provider.transpiler.passes.basis.ConvertIdToDelay
    was added which converts an :class:`qiskit.circuit.library.IGate`
    to :class:`qiskit.circuit.Delay`. This was added to the default transpiler
    plugin :class:`qiskit_ibm_provider.transpiler.plugin.IBMTranslationPlugin`.
fixes:
  - |
    A bug was fixed where conditional :class:`qiskit.circuit.library.IGate` were
    being converted to unconditional :class:`qiskit.circuit.Delay` operations
    rather than conditional operations.
